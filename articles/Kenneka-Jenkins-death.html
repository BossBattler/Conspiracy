            <p> I would like to pull attention to the topic of Kenneka Jenkins. A young woman with the name of Kenneka Jenkins, age 19, was found dead inside a hotel walk-in-freezer on the outskirts of Chicago over the weekend. There are still many unanswered questions to how she died. Kenneka was attending to a party at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in The Village of Rosemont on a Friday night. She was declared missing on Saturday, and investigators found her body in the freezer. It was said to be an accidental suicide, however I disagree. Let's start with the evidence they gave the mother of the victim. They wouldn't even let the mother see her daughter. She was quoted saying “Please, please, please, I beg you, let me know something,” she said. “Help me.” Now why wouldn't they let the mother see her own child? Maybe it's because she couldn't handle it or maybe it's because it's not what they said it was. Now when she supposedly walked into the freezer she was said to be intoxicated and barely able to hold herself up. Adding to that the freezer doors are said to be extremely heavy to open up. Even intoxicated wouldn't you notice it was a little cold. Now, evidence I concluded from this story. If you're at a party you would either have brought friends or made new ones and from my personal experience <i> Editors note: He has no personal experience with 'friends', carry on</i>, being at a party by yourself with no one you know is really boring and completely uncomfortable. So don't you think maybe she would of had some friends with her. If she did why weren't they caught on security cameras. I beielve it was a murder and she was abducted. </p>
